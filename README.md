# Image-Classification-using-Fine-tuned-Pretrained-Networks-in-MATLAB
This repository contains MATLAB code for training and evaluating image classification models using pre-trained deep learning networks. We use ResNet-50, VGG-19, and VGG-16 as the pre-trained networks and fine-tune them on a custom dataset. The project includes data preparation, training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine and make sure you have MATLAB with Deep Learning Toolbox installed.

## Dataset Preparation
Organize your dataset into three separate folders: train, val, and test. Each folder should contain subfolders representing different classes, and the images should be placed within their respective class subfolders.
